## Inside

We'll be insulating the bus a bit extra, so the wall will be more than the standard thickness.
This leaves a little long strip for a tiny garden all along the [windows](../substrate#windows) on both sides of the bus,
affording protection from cats or other curious critters.
Line the depression (how deep?) with a cut (or two) of rubber roofing/pond liner.

## Outside

Planters that can be loaded either into the bus or [underbelly](../substrate/#underbelly) for transport.

### Fencing

Might not be needed, but must be separate from dog fence.
