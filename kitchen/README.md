# Everything and the Kitchen Sink

## Sink

The [Maine State Code](../legal#maine-state-code) and [US Code of Federal Regulations](../legal#federal-regulations) want us to have a faucet with potable water.
Rain water probably doesn't satisfy this (FIXME: fact-check).

Sensible option seems to be to have a rainwater tank to the main faucet for washing things and a little spigot for drinking water.

Drain to the [grey water](../garbage/#grey-water) tank.

## Shower

Showers are not exactly kitchen things; they are part of the everything (is pretty much just a sink for humans).

The shower is in the *would be nice* category.
It demands a water heater and a fair bit of complication,
but having a space to clean things that are muddy and dirty is really really useful.

## Refrigeration

A small fridge/cooler would be nice.
Also helps validate legally being a motor home.

TODO: Research and write up notes on propane vs low voltage DC.

Memory says that propane tends to be quieter.
Electric is much more flexible though.

## Burners

We'll want stove-top burners for cooking things on.

* Propane is the most convenient
  * easy to see how much energy
  * easy to adjust
  * easy to light
  * also the most expensive
  * requires delivery or bus transport to acquire
* Hydrogen is a good option, but harder
  * invisible flame
  * easy to adjust
  * easy to light
  * can be generated from excess summer energy
  * requires catalytic help to not produce NOâ‚‚
* Alcohol is also a good option
  * nice visible flame
  * easy to adjust
  * harder to light
  * requires pressurization
  * volatile fumes
* White gas, kerosene, and waste oil are similar
  * visible flame
  * fairly easy to adjust
  * much harder to light
  * requires pressurization
  * smokey start
  * fuel varies in cost and ease of acquisition
* Wood, Charcoal, etc
  * possible with rocket stove type setup
  * smokey start
  * slower/harder to regulate heat
  * cheap and abundant fuel

## Food storage

* at the back of the counter
* shelves over the counter
* drawers under the counter?
* bulk storage somewhere?
  * some in the [underbelly](../substrate#underbelly)
