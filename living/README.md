# Look at my life; Look at my choices

## Rough layout

We approach the house from the south side, it's nose facing east.
A front and back entrance, garden layed out between them.
We climb up the steps in the front to see th driver's seat,
with one bench by the stairs for passengers when moving
(and a place to set things down when parked).
That bench and the space across from it form the mud room,
a wall separating the rest of the house with hooks for coats and things,
the space under the bench (and coats) for boots and such.

Through the door in the wall there is a long open room ending in a loft.
Shelves line the walls under the windows, plants grow behind them.
The kitchen nook is just to the left, shelves against the wall, counter by the windows, stovetop facing the room, and sink next to the corridor.
A trapdoor toilet just to the right, in an alcove of shelves with a curtain to pull across.
At the top of the wall on either side runs a long narrow shelf, for the cats, ending by the loft.

Two sets of shelves support the near side of the loft, with a small door between them.
Through the door lies a thin futon on the floor, with a desk wrapped all the way around it.
More shelves sit atop the desk beside the door and in the back,
some boxes hide underneath.
There is just enough headroom to sit on the futon with my head between the ribs supporting the loft.

Up above, in the loft, is the main bed, about the same headroom as below,
with a window looking out the back (bookended by shelves of course).
