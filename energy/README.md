## Primary System

### Needs

#### Space Heat

#### Cooking Heat

#### Low Voltage DC

Most needs are <16volt, a couple in the 20-24v, possibly some 48-60v loads.
Fairly low power all in all, maybe 1kW.

#### AC

Depends on stuff, probably mostly guest use?

#### High Voltage DC / 3-phase Square Wave

For driving the bus if eventually converted to electric.
>100kW

### Heat Sources

In the not-summer it'll be cold outside!

#### Wood, Charcoal, and other solid fuels

A well-insulated firebox with an extra-insulated chimney (aka rocket stove) will burn quite hot and efficiently.
Capturing and storing that energy in a bus is a little trickier, but definitely doable.

#### Waste Vegitible Oil and other liquid fuels

Very similar setup to the rocket stove, but doesn't need the firebox.
Produces higher grade heat than wood or charcoal.
Requires a blower for high efficiency burning.

The liquid and solid furnaces could be combined with a sliding floor at the top of the firebox...

#### Propane, Hydrogen, and other gaseous fuels

For cooking?

Combined propane / waste oil furances are a thing.

During times that we have excess energy hydrogen is relatively easily made,
just hard to store compactly.

### Electricity Generation

#### Solar Panels

On the roof, on the designated south side of the bus. Obviously.

#### From Heat Sources

The general goal is to be able to generate power as an byproduct of heating the bus.
General methods are:

* Steam turbine
* Thermal decomposition cycles (boron?)
* Solid state thermoelectric generators (expensive)

#### Fuel Cells

{insert research on waste oil fuel cells here}

#### Engine/Transmission

(Potential for regenerative breaking instead of engine breaking?)

### Electricity Storage

Lots of Li-ion batteries is the current best bet.
Lighter, longer-lived, and lower maintainence than Lead Acid with only a slight surcharge on cost.

For a full electric conversion we're looking at two battery packs, or a lot of energy conversion.

#### High Voltage

## Locomotion

Initially we're looking at straight diesel fuel.
At some point, order of a year or so,
I want to augment that to use waste vegitible oil once the engine is hot.
The process seems fairly straightforward, but needs more research.

Long term, on the order of many years,
I want to convert to electric and integrate locomotion energy with the rest of the system.
