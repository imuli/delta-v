# Mark and Sweep vs Escape Analysis

That is, garbage collection!

## Recyclables

Probably a small bin in the living space and a slightly larger one in the underbelly?
Periodic trips to a single sort transfer station would be great.

### Metal

Long term I'd like to look at metal casting with a waste oil furnace.
Not worth saving for.

### Glass

Again long term, collecting clear glass for hot work.
Probably not worth saving for.

### Plastic

Thermoplastics are worth chipping and recycling ourselves for projects.
Other plastics are too much bother.

### Paper and Cardboard

Very likely not worth recycling ourselves for paper.
Maybe keeping newsprint for fire starter though.

### Electronics

Keep a rotating bin, sometimes you really need a part right now that happens to be on some scrap.

## Nonrecyclables

Probably not much of this.
Mostly misc plastic - tape, bags, etc.
Small indoor container and a bin in the underbelly.

## Toilet and Compost

Approximating us as four adult humans,
we are looking at about 4kg of excreta a day.
Add to that say 2 kilo of coverage a day.
Were we to compost this all abord until it was suitable soil,
a year building the heap and a year composting it,
we'd be carrying around up to 4 tons of material.
Infeasible.

It's recommended to compost foor scraps and humus together.

This means building compost piles sufficient to properly heat and decompose at each location which may be difficult.

## Greywater

Some amount of greywater will be useful for the garden.
Some will go to keep the compost pile moist.
That probably still leaves a fair amount to distribute elsewhere though.

In the underbelly beneath the sink (and possibly shower),
an (insulated?) greywater tank with a bottom drain and perhaps a tube to pump up to the plantings.
