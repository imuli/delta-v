# Finding Solid Ground

or in this case, a bus.

## First Student

Their sales rep pretty much replied with a list of busses that didn't meet the specifications I asked about,
and didn't address any of my related questions.
This doesn't mean that they might not good options,
it just might be a bunch of work.

## Luce's

They are nice!

They might not have what we're seeking for sale though.
I've seen one flat nose bus as I was driving by, but it appears to be in use.
If they don't have any for sale, I suspect they'll be free with tips on what to look for.
Also I would consider asking to pay them to check out a bus from someone nearby.

## TICA LLC

Appears to only exist as a property owner on the tax maps.

Who knows how receptive they'll be to someone stopping by and asking after their stationary busses.

## LA

I think their only flat nosed busses are ex-coach busses?
Given that I'm almost an employee I might as well inquire.

## Online

### Ebay

A variety of busses in a decent price range.
Scattered all everywhere though.

### Craigslist

There are sometimes options.
Usually not terribly good ones.
