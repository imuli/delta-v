# The Substrate

## Overview

This is to be a travelling house with the express goal of minimizing barriers to relocation.
Moving need not be more than securing loose bits and bobs, packing up anything kept outside, and driving off.
Thus the primary substrate candidates are used busses.

## Body Styles

A decent overview blog [post](http://www.buslandia.net/blog/2016/10/11/choosing-a-body-style-length).

|  Consideration  | Conventional | Rear-Engine | Front-Engine |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Maneuverablity  | Difficult    | Good        | Good         |
| Basement        | Little       | Lots        | Very Little  |
| Usable Length   | -10ft        | -5ft        | -5ft         |
| Engine Access   | Excellent    | Acceptible  | Difficult    |
| Back Door       | Yes          | No          | Yes          |
| Noise           | Fine         | Quiet       | Loud         |
| Availability    | 85%          | 5%          | 10%          |

I am inclined toward Rear-Engine.

### Conventional

The normal school bus, big engine out front.
[Huge turning radius](http://www.skoolie.net/forums/f13/pro-con-of-flatnose-re-conventional-15568.html#edit168887),
familiar to repair shops,
supposedly cheaper.
The drive shaft runs all the way back to the rear wheels, so there's not much room underneath.
The nose takes up a bunch of length, 
There's a rear door though.
[Best Clearance?](http://www.buslandia.net/blog/2016/10/11/choosing-a-body-style-length#block-yui_3_17_2_20_1476493308387_13434)
Loose about 10 feet of length to driving and engine.

### Rear-Engine

The engine is located in the back of the bus, sticking up into the passenger area a little, with access panels on the outside.
This gives an extra 5ish feet of space inside the bus for a given length, so a 40' bus has 35' of usable length.
The engine blocks the back of the bus, so unless we add another side door or find one with a lift we only have one door.
The weight is concentrated over the drive wheels, so this has the best traction.

### Front-Engine

Flat-nosed like the rear-engine style, but with the engine below/beside the driver's seat.
Awkwardly curved steps due to the engine being somewhat in the way.
Noisy and hot to drive.
Not much room for storage underneath the bus, worse than the conventional.

## Fuel

More in [energy](../energy/), but the long and short is that Diesel is cheaper to start with, more reliable, and provides the short term opportunity to use waste vegitible oil.

## Dimensions

Busses are generally close to 8' wide on the outside and up to 40'.
With insulation in the walls I'd expect about 7' of internal width, maybe a bit less.
That at 20' long replicates the current living space, so anything more than a 26' flatnose would give us more space.
Windows tend to be about 3ft off the floor.
Internal height varies a bunch, but tends to be around 6' or so.

## Rework

### Insulation

#### Floor

People recommend using 1-2" of hard foam sheets for the floor covered by plywood and then flooring.
I am inclined to go for sufficietly rigid foam to support the flooring directly.

#### Walls and Ceiling

It looks like spray foam insulation is the best - especially for conforming to the curve of the ceiling.
Extra insulation around the struts seems valuable.

#### Conduit

Before foaming the walls, installing PVC conduit for easy wire (or fibre optic or whatever) runs seems valuable.
Also in the ceiling for lighting and roof solar panels.

#### Surface

I am inclined to go with one-side-smooth plywood for the floor and walls at least, possibly foamed in place.
[These folks](http://outsidefound.com/2015/01/project-bus-update-8/) used white breadboard for the ceiling.

### Windows

Bus windows are terribly leaky.
On the other hand, taking them all out and replacing them with fixed windows is extra work.
The [growing things](../growth/) plans call for two layers of windows, separated by a planting space.

### Internal partitions

It may make sense to wall off a bit of the front as the driving area/mud room (hard space to keep warm).
Walling off the back end for a work/guest room might make sense too, especially if we have another door back there.

### Underbelly

Storage areas for anything we don't need regular access to and doesn't mind getting cold.

* Batteries/DC-DC regulator/Inverter/etc
* Servers
* Propane (if we have it)
* Freshwater (insulated)
* Greywater? (insulated) (integrate with growing things?)
* Storage for portable fencing?
* Planter transport space?
* Outdoor tools

This may involve a fair amount of fabrication to enclose spaces in the underbelly.
